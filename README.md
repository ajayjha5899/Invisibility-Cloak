# Invisibility-Cloak
python script which makes you invisible

The code is self explanatory. This was a stupid project done because a video pushed me to try it.
1. Use hsv-detector.py to choose hsv values for a particular colour.
2. Input those values in the InvisibilityCloak.py script.

Happy invisibility.
